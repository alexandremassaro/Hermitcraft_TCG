# Hermitcraft TCG

Hermitcraft TCG is a card game based on the popular Hermitcraft Minecraft server, created by the player VintageBeef. This implementation of the game was created using the Godot Game Engine, and tries to faithfully recreate the gameplay experience of the original TCG.

## Gameplay

In Hermitcraft TCG, players use decks of cards representing various Hermitcraft members and their items and abilities to defeat their opponents. Each turn, players draw a card and can play cards from their hand to attack their opponent or defend against their opponent's attacks. The game ends when three Hermits, of the same player, have their health reduced to zero.
